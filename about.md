# Who is Benjamin Daniel Lawless?
I have been writing poetry for over 25 years, and have been speaking publicly for more than 15. I went to school to [learn how to design and produce mass media](http://www.grc.calpoly.edu/).

Originally from San Diego, I moved to the Central Coast of California in 2001.
