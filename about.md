# Who is Benjamin Daniel Lawless?
I have been writing poetry for over 25 years, and have been speaking publicly for more than 15. I went to school to [learn how to design and produce mass media](http://www.grc.calpoly.edu/).

By day, [I manage a team of web developers](//level-studios.com). I also am a father. In my spare time (ha ha), I [design and publish books](//penciledin.com).

## Colophon:
&lt;/&gt; The site structure and design is based on <a href="http://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain" title="a minimalist Jekyll theme for personal blog">The Plain theme</a> by <a href="http://heiswayi.github.io">Heiswayi Nrird</a>. All modifications made by Benjamin Daniel Lawless.
