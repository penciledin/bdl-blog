Recently, many poets I've worked with have been agreeing to create a performance book. We have been calling them Reading Copies.

These books are intended to be much easier to read in a performance setting. They may feature:

- Larger pages for easier turning and the possibility of laying flat if a podium is available
- Larger text that is easier to read in low light or with less-than-stellar eyesight
- Comments and stories about certain pieces to add flavor to the performance.
- A different order of poems that fit performances better.

Depending on how different it is from the original copy, it may not take much effort to produce this new book.
