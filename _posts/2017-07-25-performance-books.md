Recently, I've worked with many poets to create performance books (sometimes calling them "Reading Copies").

These books are intended to be much easier to read in a performance setting. They may feature:

- Larger pages for easier turning and the possibility of laying flat if a podium is available.
- Larger text that is easier to read in low light.
- Comments and stories about certain pieces to add flavor to the performance.
- A different order of poems that fit performances better.

Depending on how different it is from the original copy, it may not take much effort to produce this new book.

Many choose to keep the performance copy private (i.e., not for sale), but I'm starting to reconsider that stance. There is a benefit to providing a [Large-print book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-print) for those with poor vision.
