At [Bowker](https://www.myidentifiers.com/get-your-isbn-now) — the only provider of ISBNs in America — ISBNs can be pretty expensive.

| Number of ISBNs | Price | Price per unit |
| --------------: | -----:| --------------:|
| 1 ISBN		  | $125  | $125           |
| 10 ISBNs		  | $295  | $29.50 		   |
| 100 ISBNs		  | $575  | $5.75 		   |

I use CreateSpace almost exclusively for printing all the books for Penciled In. Good news! CreateSpace can provide a free ISBN for your book. The only catch is all CreateSpace provided ISBNs will list CreateSpace as the publisher of the book.

Given the ease to publish through CreateSpace, there are a lot of people jumping on this deal. As such there is no quality control for the artistry of books printed through them.

If you value good design and you want your book to stand out from the pack, get your own ISBNs. If you are planning on publishing a few books with e-book versions, consider getting a large volume of them.

If you're considering publishing and would like to team up with Penciled In on your project (and would perhaps like to pay a fair value for a Penciled In ISBN), [contact me](mailto:ben@penciledin.com).
