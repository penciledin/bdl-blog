At [Bowker](https://www.myidentifiers.com/get-your-isbn-now) — the only provider of ISBNs in America — ISBNs can be pretty expensive.

| Number of ISBNs | Price | Price per unit |
| --------------: | -----:| --------------:|
| 1 ISBN		  | $125  | $125           |
| 10 ISBNs		  | $295  | $29.50 		   |
| 100 ISBNs		  | $575  | $5.75 		   |

I use CreateSpace for printing all the books for Penciled In. Good news! [CreateSpace can provide a free ISBN for your book.](https://www.createspace.com/Products/Book/ISBNs.jsp)

But consider this:

- All CreateSpace provided ISBNs will list CreateSpace as the publisher of the book.
- [If your book has a CreateSpace ISBN, you must buy your copies from CreateSpace. You can't use another printer to print books with an ISBN from CreateSpace](https://writers.stackexchange.com/questions/12952/if-i-get-a-free-isbn-through-amazons-createspace-now-will-that-impact-any-deci).
- There is no quality control for the artistry of books printed through them.

If you value and produce good design and you want your book to stand out from the pack, get your own ISBN. If you plan on publishing multiple editions (audio, ebook, another trim size, a significant change of content), consider getting a large volume of them.

Would you like to work with Penciled In on your project (and would like to pay a fair value for a Penciled In ISBN)? [Contact me](mailto:ben@penciledin.com)! I'd love to hear from you!
